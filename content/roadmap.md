title: Roadmap
description: "Known limitations and strategic goals for BAM Engine."
---

Originally developed as part of MSc thesis research at the University of
Piraeus, BAM Engine is now a personal project under independent
development. This roadmap outlines known limitations and strategic goals
for the project. No timelines are attached; priorities may shift as
development progresses.

For bug reports and feature requests, see the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/kganitis/bam-engine/issues).

## Known Limitations

The following structural issues are documented and under investigation.
There is strong evidence that they share interconnected root causes, so
they are best understood as facets of the same underlying problem rather
than independent bugs.

**Labor Market Quantization Trap**

The ceiling function in the hiring rule (`ceil(desired_production / phi)`)
creates a one-way ratchet: at small firm sizes, firms can increase their
workforce but never decrease it. This inflates employment and suppresses
the unemployment rate. See the labor market section of the
[User Guide](https://bam-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/bam_model.html)
for details.

**Credit Market Inactivity (Kalecki Trap)**

The Kalecki profit identity guarantees that aggregate profits exceed
costs, causing firms to accumulate net worth faster than they accumulate
debt. Once the net-worth-to-wage-bill ratio reaches its steady-state
attractor (~12x), firms self-finance entirely and borrowing demand drops
to zero. The dividend payout rate (`delta`) is the only effective
parameter lever. See the credit market section of the
[User Guide](https://bam-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/bam_model.html)
for details.

**Price Dynamics**

Several price-related metrics deviate from reference targets: low mean
inflation, low dispersion in firm-level prices, equity, and sales, and a
high ratio of market price to market-clearing price. These are likely
downstream consequences of the credit and labor market traps reducing
competitive pressure.

## Strategic Goals

**Model Accuracy**

Resolve the structural traps described above, improve price dynamics, and
achieve a closer match to the simulation results in the reference book
(Delli Gatti et al., 2011).

**Architecture & API**

Make the framework more powerful and easier to extend:

- **Role-based agent identity**: Today, agents exist only as implicit
  array indices inside roles, and each role is hardcoded to a single agent
  type (firms, households, or banks). The goal is to make agents
  first-class entities that own their roles, so the engine discovers
  participants by querying for roles ("which agents have the Borrower
  role?") rather than by type. This would allow the same role to be shared
  across different agent types and new agent kinds to be introduced without
  changing the core.

- **Economy as self-contained context**: Currently, events receive the
  entire Simulation object and reach through it to access roles,
  configuration, and economy state. Extracting the economy into a
  standalone context that events receive directly would decouple the model
  definition from the simulation driver, and open the door to running
  multiple economies within a single simulation (e.g., multi-country
  simulations).

- **Multi-point data collection**: The data collector currently captures
  each metric once per step (at the end or after a single designated
  event). Supporting capture at multiple points within the same step would
  let users observe how variables evolve across events within a period.

- **Easier extensibility**: Adding new roles and events is
  straightforward, but extending or customizing existing ones (e.g., adding
  fields to a built-in role) requires workarounds. The registration system
  should support extending existing components without breaking discovery.

**Research Extensions**

Add extensions from the broader CATS family: CC-MABM, a capital and
credit extension implemented in Julia, and R-MABM, a
reinforcement-learning extension of CC-MABM in Python and Julia. See the
[Community](/community/) page for full details on these projects.
